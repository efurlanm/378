# My personal notes from CAP 378 Earth Observation Topics


Course program

This discipline aims to situate how computing as a discipline is inserted in activities related to space programs in terms of the components of an Earth Observation Systems using orbital platforms, from the design of ground activities to the end user. They are presented: an overview of the history of space programs in the world and in particular the Brazilian space program is outlined; a history of INPE's participation in global and regional Earth observation programs; policies regarding orbital remote sensing data; INPE's missions relating to this part of the space program. Applications in computing technologies such as geographic databases, image processing, geographic information systems, spatial analysis and other methodologies for the computational treatment of orbital remote sensing data. It presents and the interface of this technology with a universe of applications ranging from environmental monitoring and alerts to health surveillance systems on a territorial basis.
